# Choose Your Own Adventure!  

Purpose of project : This project was meant to be a creative outlet in which we could practice our skills on git and github. It helped us practice finally implementing all of our commandline skills such as links and headlines, in a user-friendly project which would be interactive with the user, something we hadn't done before.
